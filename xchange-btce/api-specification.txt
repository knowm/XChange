API v.3 specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This api provides access to information such as tickers, active orders, the last trades, etc.

All requests to the API go to the following address:
https://btc-e.com/api/3/<method name>/<list of currency pairs>

A dash (-) is used to separate pairs in the list, for example:
https://btc-e.com/api/3/ticker/btc_usd-btc_rur

You can use any number of pairs in the list. Duplicates are not allowed. You can use only one pair, e.g.
https://btc-e.com/api/3/ticker/btc_usd
The set of pairs works with all the methods presented in the Public api, except info.

All information is cached every 2 seconds, so there is no point in making requests more often.
All answers from api come in JSON format.

Important:
Api will throw an error if we disable one of the pairs listed in your request. If you are not going to synchronize
the state of the pairs via info method, it is worth to set GET-parameter ignore_invalid to 1, for example:
https://btc-e.com/api/3/ticker/btc_usd-btc_btc?ignore_invalid=1
Without ignore_invalid this request would cause an error due to a non-existent pair.


info
----
This method provides information about currently active pairs, such as the maximum number of
decimals in the trades, minimum price, maximum price, the minimum amount for bid/ask,
whether a pair is hidden and a fee for the pair.

Example:
https://btc-e.com/api/3/info

Sample answer:
{
	"server_time":1370814956,

		"btc_usd":{

Hidden pair (Hidden = 1) works through API, but does not appear in the list of pairs on the main page.
The fee is displayed for all users, even if it is changed for your own account (for example by some bonus offer).
If we turn off any pair, it just will disappear from the list.
