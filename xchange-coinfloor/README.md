## Coinfloor BIST

Connects to the [Coinfloor BIST API](https://github.com/coinfloor/API/blob/master/BIST.md). For authenticated calls the exchange specification
must be configured with a Coinfloor username and password. The username is constructed by concatenating the numeric user ID, a forward slash, 
and the user's API authentication cookie. The password is the same as setup on the main Coinfloor website.
