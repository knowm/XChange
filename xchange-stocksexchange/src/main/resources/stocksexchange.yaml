#  <!--The base URL for all the requests other than ticker is https://stocks.exchange/api2.
#
#       In order to use the API functions, you must have an API key and API secret, which is generated in the user profile.
#
#       Authentication
#       Most of the calls described next require authentication. All those are POST requests that must be created according to the following steps:
#
#       Include a unique 'nonce' argument (numeric value).
#       Include an 'method' argument set to the end point for the request.
#       Represent the (key, value) pairs present in the request as JSON. Let SIGNDATA be the result of this step.
#       Calculate the HMAC-SHA512 of SIGNDATA using your API secret.
#       Create a 'Sign' header and set its value to the hexadecimal digest resulting from the HMAC-SHA512 calculation.
#       Create a 'Key' header and set its value to your API key.
#       Send a POST request with the parameter SIGNDATA.
