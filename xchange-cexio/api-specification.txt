API authentication
==================

All private API calls require authentication. You need to provide 3 parameters to authenticate a request:

key - API key
nonce - Nonce
signature - Signature


API key
-------
To get an API key, go to "Account", "Security" and then "API Access". Set parmissions and click "Generate key".

Nonce
-----
Nonce is a regular integer number. It must be increasing with every request you make.
A common practice is to use unix time for that parameter.

Signature
---------
Signature is a HMAC-SHA256 encoded message containing: nonce, client ID and API key.
The HMAC-SHA256 code must be generated using a secret key that was generated with your API key.
This code must be converted to it's hexadecimal representation (64 uppercase characters).
