API v1 Documentation
====================

This document describes the Bitcoin-Central.net v1 API.


# General API description

## Authentication

Authentication is currently done as previously with `HTTP Basic`. The regular username and password should be used. This is deprecated and will soon be replaced with OAuth2.

Calls that require authentication are marked with "A" in the call description title.

## Base URL

The base URL for all calls is `https://bitcoin-central.net`. A complete URL would look like this `https://bitcoin-central.net/api/v1/quotes/3a7bc1b2-9b7e-4dc3-9ffc-b3c08962ff4d`.

## Formats and required HTTP request headers

The API will only answer with JSON or empty responses. It expects parameters to be passed in JSON with the correct `Content-Type: application/json` being set.

## Pagination

Some API calls returning collections may be paginated. In this case the call description title mentions it.

Calls that return paginated data are marked with "P" in the call description title.

### HTTP response header

Calls that return paginated collections will add a `Pagination` HTT header to the response. It will contain a pagination meta-data JSON object.

**Pagination header example**

    {
      // Whether the current page is the first of the collection
      "first_page": true,

      // Total amount of available pages
      "total_pages": 1,

      // Previous page number
      "previous_page": null,

      // Total number of items in the collection
      "total": 1,

      // Next page number
      "next_page": null,

      // Whether the current page is the last available one
      "last_page": true,

      // Record collection offset
      "offset": 0
    }

### Controlling pagination

Optional pagination parameters may be passed in the request URI in order to control the way the collection gets paginated. If parameters are incorrect a HTTP 400 Bad request status is returned along with an empty body.

| Parameter	| Default |	Acceptable values              |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| page      | 1       | Positive integer >0            |
| per_page  | 20      | Positive integer >=5 and <=100 |

## Localization

The relevant results and error messages will be localized to the language associated to the user, currently English and French are supported.

## Error handling

Whenever an error is encountered, the answer to a JSON API call will have :

 * An HTTP 422 status (Unprocessable entity) or HTTP 400 (Bad request),
 * A JSON array of localized error messages as body

## Successful calls

If the API call was successful, the platform will answer with :

 * An HTTP 200 status (OK) or HTTP 201 (Created),
 * A JSON representation of the entity being created or updated if relevant

## Quotes

Quotes are a mechanism for clients to send funds or exchange them to other currencies. They provide clients with a guaranteed fixed-rate at which the system will convert their funds before crediting them to their account or send them out.

The canonical use of a quote is to pay in currency to a Bitcoin invoice, materialized as a QR code :

 1. User scans Bitcoin QR code
 2. Client app extracts requested Bitcoin amount
 3. Client app requests a quote for this Bitcoin amount to the API and provides the currency in which debit upon quote payment
 4. A guaranteed rate is returned by the API
 5. Client app shows price expressed in the user's currency
 6. After user confirmation the client app instructs the API to pay the quote to a specific Bitcoin address
 7. The merchant receives the payment in Bitcoin and the user is debited in his native currency
 
### Create a quote (A)

This call will create a quote. When doing so clients must specify a currency (the other currency is always assumed to be "BTC") an amount they are requesting and a direction. Combining these parameters in various ways will have the system address a wide array of use cases. 

For example a client can request :

 1. How much BTC would need to be sold to get exactly 10 EUR
 2. How much BTC could be bought with 10 EUR
 3. How much EUR would the sale of 1 BTC get
 4. How much EUR would be required to buy 1 BTC

To obtain the relevant quote a client would pass the following parameters :

| Case | Currency | direction | requested\_btc\_amount | requested\_currency\_amount |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | EUR      | sell      | N/A                    | 10                          |
| 2    | EUR      | buy       | N/A                    | 10                          |
| 3    | EUR      | sell      | 1                      | N/A                         |
| 4    | EUR      | buy       | 1                      | N/A                         |

| requested\_currency\_amount | Decimal | Constrain on the currency amount (1)                                   |

| currency                    | String  | Currency in which the requested_amount is expressed                    |

 1. Exactly one of the currencies must be constrained, the other parameter may be omitted
 2. Acceptable values are `buy` and `sell`

## Invoices

Invoices are requests for payment. They can be expressed in any arbitrary currency. They all get a unique Bitcoin payment address assigned and a Bitcoin amount calculated from the requested currency amount.

Payment can be made by sending the `btc_amount` amount of Bitcoins to the `payment_address` address or directly in the requested currency from another account. The invoice payment will trigger a `POST`to the `callback_url`.
