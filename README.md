XChange is a Java library providing a simple and consistent API for interacting with 60+ Bitcoin and other crypto currency exchanges providing a
consistent interface for trading and accessing market data.

## Important!

The world of Bitcoin changes quickly and XChange is no exception. For the latest bugfixes and features you should use the [snapshot jars] (https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/knowm/xchange/) or build yourself from the DEVELOP branch. See below for more details about building with Maven. To report bugs and see what issues people are currently working on see the [issues page](https://github.com/knowm/XChange/issues). 

## Description

XChange is a library providing a simple and consistent API for interacting with a diverse set of crypto currency exchanges, including support for Bitcoin. 

A complete list of implemented exchanges, data providers and brokers can be found on our [Exchange Support](https://github.com/knowm/XChange/wiki/Exchange-Support) page. 

Usage is very simple: Create an Exchange instance, get the appropriate service, and request data.

## Example 1: Public Market Data

```java
Exchange bitstamp = ExchangeFactory.INSTANCE.createExchange(BitstampExchange.class.getName());

MarketDataService marketDataService = bitstamp.getMarketDataService();

Ticker ticker = marketDataService.getTicker(CurrencyPair.BTC_USD);

System.out.println(ticker.toString());
```

## Example 2: Private Account Info

To use the private API services, `AccountService` and `TradeService`, create an `ExchangeSpecification` with a unique API key and secret key (in some
cases more info is required), which you obtain through the exchange's web interface. For more examples of adding the keys to the
`ExchangeSpecification` including storing them in a configuration file, see [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/knowm/XChange/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

```java
ExchangeSpecification exSpec = new BitstampExchange().getDefaultExchangeSpecification();
exSpec.setUserName("34387");
exSpec.setApiKey("a4SDmpl9s6xWJS5fkKRT6yn41vXuY0AM");
exSpec.setSecretKey("sisJixU6Xd0d1yr6w02EHCb9UwYzTNuj");
Exchange bitstamp = ExchangeFactory.INSTANCE.createExchange(exSpec);

// Get the account information
AccountService accountService = bitstamp.getAccountService();
AccountInfo accountInfo = accountService.getAccountInfo();
System.out.println(accountInfo.toString());
```

All exchange implementations expose the same API, but you can also directly access the underlying "raw" data from the individual exchanges if you need to.

Now go ahead and [study some more examples](http://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/xchange-example-code), [download the thing](http://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/xchange-change-log/) and [provide feedback](https://github.com/knowm/XChange/issues).

## Getting Started

### Non-Maven

Download XChange Release Jars: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cknowm%20xchange

Download XChange Snapshot Jars: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/knowm/xchange/

### Maven

The XChange release artifacts are hosted on Maven Central. 
  
Add the following dependencies in your pom.xml file. You will need at least xchange-core. Add the additional dependencies for the exchange modules you are interested in (XYZ shown only for a placeholder). There is example code for all the modules in xchange-examples.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.knowm.xchange</groupId>
      <artifactId>xchange-core</artifactId>
      <version>4.3.9</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.knowm.xchange</groupId>
      <artifactId>xchange-examples</artifactId>
      <version>4.3.9</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.knowm.xchange</groupId>
      <artifactId>xchange-XYZ</artifactId>
      <version>4.3.9</version>
    </dependency>

For snapshots, add the following repository to your pom.xml file.

    <repository>
      <id>sonatype-oss-snapshot</id>
      <snapshots/>
      <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
